ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
Heart disease prevention is critical, and data-driven prediction systems can significantly aid in early diagnosis and treatment. Machine Learning offers accurate prediction capabilities, enhancing healthcare outcomes.
In this project, I analyzed a Heart Disease Dataset with appropriate preprocessing. Multiple classification algorithms were implemented in Python using Scikit-learn and Keras to predict the presence of heart disease.
