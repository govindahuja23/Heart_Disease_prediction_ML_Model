Project Objective
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Heart disease prevention is critical, and data-driven prediction systems can significantly aid in early diagnosis and treatment. Machine Learning offers accurate prediction capabilities, enhancing healthcare outcomes. In this project, I analyzed a heart disease dataset with appropriate preprocessing. Multiple classification algorithms were implemented in Python using Scikit-learn and Keras to predict the presence of heart disease.
